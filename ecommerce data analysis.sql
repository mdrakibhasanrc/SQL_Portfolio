-- Business Case: An E-Commerce company has been collecting data from its customer during the last 2 years of its operation. The collected data is used to help the management and operation for analyzing and answering some questions they face in their daily business operation. There are 3 datasets used in analyzing and answering the above questions, mainly the order_detail, sku_detail, and payment_detail datasets. The questions are as follows with query:

-- Q1: Of all the paid transactions that took place during the 2021, in what month did the maximum total transaction (after_discount) happen?

select
   monthname( order_date) as month,
   round(sum(after_discount),2) as Total_sales
from 
    order_detail
where
    is_valid=1 and year(order_date)=2021
group by
     month
order by
     Total_sales desc;
     
-- Q2: Of all the paid transactions that took place during the 2021, in what month did the total customer (unique), total order (unique), and the total quantity number of product reach their maximum?

select
   monthname( order_date) as month,
   count(distinct customer_id) as Total_customer,
   count(distinct id) as Total_order,
   sum(qty_ordered) as total_quantity
from 
    order_detail
where
    is_valid=1 and year(order_date)=2021

     month
order by
     total_quantity desc,Total_customer desc, Total_order desc;

-- Q4: By comparing the paid transaction value of each product category between year 2021 and 2022, what are the product categories that experienced improvement, and what are the product categories that experienced decrement of their corresponding transaction values during the period of 2021 and 2022?
